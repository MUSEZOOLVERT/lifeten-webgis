# Installation INSTRUCTIONS
mkdir build && cd build
# Here we have various variables at our disposal:
#   WWWLIBS_INSTALL_PREFIX - path to /var/www/ or any other web root folder
#	HSLAYERS_WEBSERVER_PREFIX - path for the hslayers on the webserver /hslayers/version/
#		The above variables get folded into full install path /var/www/hslayers/version/
#		This behavior can be ultimately overriden by variable HSLAYERS_INSTALL_PREFIX
#		which overrides install path, does not affect the WEBSERVER prefix.
#		Overriding this variable is useful when you use symlinks and want to place
#		hslayers installation elsewhere than it might seem in the end.
# Remember. All variables are used as -DVARIABLE=VALUE.
# If you dont like the commandline interface substitute cmake with ccmake or
# cmake-gui command, where you can just click all the variables in :]

cmake .. -DHSLAYERS_WEBSERVER_PREFIX="/hlayers/testing/"
make
make install
